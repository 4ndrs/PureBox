# PureBox

Utility to draw rectangles on programs using Xlib to get x, y, width, height coordinates.

Originally written for [PureMPV](https://github.com/4ndrs/PureMPV), with this script it is possible to get the relative x, y, height, width coordinates of a drawn rectangle inside an X11 application given its PID. It uses the [Python X library](https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib) to communicate with the X server.
